## Details

This app is built on Angular 1.6, Bootstrap 4, Font Awesome 5, jQuery 3, and Firebase. This is intentional. There are many newer technologies that I could have used, and am well versed in many of them, but the point of this project was something that worked, was easy to build and a technology I knew well and didn't have to learn. These dependencies meet that spec.
